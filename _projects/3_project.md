Labelling Flora is a VR application designed to simplify the annotation of 3D point clouds, offering a more immersive experience compared to traditional methods. Developed using the Unity Game Engine and compatible with HTC Vive VR Head-mounted displays, this application is specifically tailored for annotating dense 3D point clouds of tree stems. However, the VR labelling method introduced by Labelling Flora is versatile and can be applied to any other 3D point cloud dataset, with a maximum of 20 million points per cloud, that requires semantic information association.
